# Mask DINO + Guided Distillation for Semi-Supervised Instance Segmentation

## Overview

This repository merges the functionalities of **Mask DINO** and **Guided Distillation for Semi-Supervised Instance Segmentation** (based on Mask2Former) into a unified codebase. The combined approach aims to leverage the strengths of both methods for improved performance in object detection and segmentation tasks.

### Projects

1. **[Mask DINO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02777)**: Mask DINO is a unified transformer-based framework for object detection and segmentation. It achieves state-of-the-art results across various segmentation tasks, including instance, panoptic, and semantic segmentation.
